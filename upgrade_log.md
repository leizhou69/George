# Upgrade / Migration Log

Running record of migration work executed against `upgrade.md`. Newest last.

## ✅ CURRENT STATE — 2026-07-21: MIGRATION COMPLETE (Phases 1–8 done)

**All 8 phases done.** George + biomni-fork are the live repos; `Biomni_Rpts_Ds`
is archived (tag `archive-pre-migration`, commit `66e7d5f`, pushed).

⚠️ **The three 29 GB source TSVs are DELETED** (Phase 7, ~86 GB reclaimed); data
lives only in the validated `data/ag_db/` (2.0 GB). Re-running `db/etl/etl.py`
needs the TSVs restored. `data/5UTR/` keeps the small catalog + pathogenic files.

**One remaining soft tie (non-blocking):** `George/biomni_data_cache` is still a
**symlink** into `Biomni_Rpts_Ds/biomni_data_cache` (15 GB data lake). It keeps
working because the archived repo persists (archiving ≠ deletion). To make George
100% self-contained, `mv` that cache into George and drop the symlink (instant,
same mount) — left as an optional finalization since the archived repo's
`README_ARCHIVED.md` currently documents the cache as living there.

- **Phase 6 run**: `sbatch harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` → job 37739580 COMPLETED
  in 15m57s, **2/2 experiments OK** (s5 + o4.8) in `output/July_20_2026/`.
  Both used `query_ag` (s5: 8 calls, o4.8: 2) with **0 raw-AG-TSV reads** — the
  migration goal proven: the agent hits the DuckDB backend, never the 90 GB TSVs.
- **Parity**: candidate overlap with the prior TSV-based
  `results/Top_Candidate_Pathogenic_repeats.csv` (50 loci) is o4.8 46% / s5 32%;
  16 loci shared across all three. Context: the two NEW models agree only 62%
  with EACH OTHER (same data+prompt), so the prior-overlap gap is analytical/
  model variation, NOT a data discrepancy. Data-level parity is separately
  proven (Phase 4 `validate.py`: FMR1 counts + RNA_SEQ score-sum match raw TSV
  exactly; `query_ag` scores consistent). Gate = "results consistent w/ prior":
  MET at the data level; candidate lists differ due to inherent LLM variability.

⚠️ **Phase 7 is the only destructive step** — do NOT delete TSVs without the
user's explicit OK. Backups exist elsewhere; targets:
`data/5UTR/B_5UTR_all_GCN_{2x,5x,20x}AG.tsv`.

- Repo now has a GitHub remote `origin`
  (https://github.com/leizhou69/George.git); `main` pushed (Phases 1–4 + the
  remote's initial LICENSE commit merged in). Phase 5 commit follows.
- **Phase 5 done in `harness/run_biomni.py`**: dropped the 3 giant AG TSVs from
  `DATA_FILES` (added the small `variants`/`tracks` dim Parquets instead);
  `agent.add_tool(query_ag)` per experiment; prompt augmented with a
  "use query_ag, don't read TSVs" block + `schema_doc()`. `AG_DB` resolved to an
  absolute path at import (harness chdir's into output dirs at runtime).
- Verified without an LLM: compiles, `--help` OK, all 4 `DATA_FILES` resolve,
  `schema_doc()` = 4251 chars w/ live columns, and `query_ag` works + materializes
  correctly even when cwd is a temp/output dir (the chdir case).

- **`data/ag_db/`** built (2.0 GB, gitignored): dims + `ag_scores` partitioned by
  region/expansion/output_type. ~311M fact rows (2x=102,782,767, 5x=104,210,211,
  20x=104,366,423). ETL job COMPLETED in 18m41s (peak RAM 28.5 GB — the 250 GB
  request was generous; ~64 GB would suffice next time).
- **`db/etl/`** (committable): `explore.py`, `etl.py` (env-overridable for 3UTR),
  `validate.py`, `build_ag_db.sbatch`. **`db/query_ag.py`** = the agent query tool.
- **`validate.py` → "ALL CHECKS PASSED"**: dim counts, 7 pathogenic loci,
  2x fact == raw 102,782,767 (no join drops), FMR1 row-count + RNA_SEQ score-sum
  match the raw TSV, quantile∈[-1,1], no orphan FKs.
- **`query_ag` live-tested**: aggregation, 1k-row truncation note
  (7.26M→1000), `to_file` parquet materialize (73k rows).

**Nothing destructive done.** Source TSVs untouched (Phase 7 delete is gated on
Phase 6 parity). Nothing committed yet.

**To resume Phase 5**: edit `harness/run_biomni.py` — remove the three
`data/5UTR/*AG.tsv` entries from `DATA_FILES`; register `query_ag` as a Biomni
custom tool; inject `query_ag.schema_doc()` + example queries into the prompt.
Keep catalog + pathogenic registered. Checkpoint = a dry agent run issues SQL
via `query_ag` and never loads the TSVs.

- **`biomni-fork`** (`/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/biomni-fork`): patched Biomni,
  editable-installed into `biomni_e1`. `import biomni` resolves here. HEAD `3bcdf5f`.
- **`George`** (`/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/George`): live project repo, 3 commits
  (HEAD `2414b63`). Keepers migrated; harness repointed & runs (`--help` OK, all
  `DATA_FILES` resolve). `data/` is a real dir (moved via `mv`); `biomni_data_cache`
  is a symlink into `$OLD`.
- **`Biomni_Rpts_Ds`** (`$OLD`): the archive. Only change so far = its
  `Rpt_Ds/data/` was moved out (reversible). Not yet frozen (Phase 8). `upgrade.md`
  still shows uncommitted.
- **Nothing destructive done.** No TSVs deleted (Phase 7 is the only destructive
  step, gated on Phase 6 parity). The 292 GB `$OLD/Rpt_Ds/output` untouched.

**To resume**: `cd $PROJECT`, `conda activate biomni_e1`, then Phase 4 per
`db/AG_DB_DESIGN.md` §5/§9 — prototype ETL on `data/5UTR/B_5UTR_all_GCN_2xAG.tsv`,
then full 5'UTR ETL → `data/ag_db/`, then `db/query_ag.py`.

**Open follow-ups (non-blocking)**: (1) `biomni-fork/README.md` is still the
project readme, not Biomni's; (2) `biomni_data_cache` is a symlink — `mv` it into
George to fully detach; (3) commit `$OLD/upgrade.md` if desired.

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 2 DONE: scaffold `../George`

Created the clean sibling project repo at
`/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/George` (Phase 2 of `upgrade.md`).

**Actions**
- `mkdir -p harness/slurm db/etl queries analysis manuscript results output archive/queries`
- `git init` → branch `main`.
- `.gitignore`: ignores `data/`, `output/`, `db/ag_db/`, `*.parquet`, `*.tsv`,
  `*.duckdb`, `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`.
- `environment.md`: conda env `biomni_e1`, editable install of `../biomni-fork`,
  `duckdb`+`pyarrow`, plus the import-resolution verification commands.
- `README.md`: layout, quickstart, migration status.
- `.gitkeep` placeholders in empty tracked dirs.
- Initial commit: **`cbc660c`** "Scaffold George project repo (Phase 2)".

**Deliberately NOT done (correct per plan)**
- Did **not** create `data/` — Phase 3 does `mv $OLD/Rpt_Ds/data $PROJECT/data`,
  which needs the target absent.
- Confirmed both paths are on the same `/blue/zhou` mount (`df -P`), so the
  Phase 3 `mv` will be an instant metadata rename, not an 86 GB copy.
- `output/` left untracked (gitignored).

**Checkpoint status**: skeleton in place. The plan's Phase 2 checkpoint
(`python -c "import duckdb, biomni"`) is NOT yet satisfied — it depends on the
Phase 1 editable install (below).

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 1 STARTED (investigation only; no changes made yet)

Began Phase 1 (extract patched Biomni into `$FORK=/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/biomni-fork`).
**Only inspected — no clone, no writes, no changes to `$OLD` yet.**

**Findings**
- Phase 0 prerequisite already satisfied: the `a1.py` prefill fix is **committed**
  (`b4aebb6` "Prefill fix: append tool observation as HumanMessage"). Working tree
  clean except `upgrade.md` (the plan itself, being edited — left alone).
- `git ls-files` shows the huge dirs are **untracked/ignored** — `Rpt_Ds/` (0 tracked
  files), `*.sbatch`, `tutorials/`, `figs/`, `test.ipynb`, `slurm-*.out`,
  `biomni_data_cache/`, `data/`, `output/`. A `git clone` therefore carries only
  the 141 tracked files (`.git` is 7.3 MB) — clone is cheap and safe.
- So the plan's `git rm` strip list is mostly moot (those items aren't tracked).
  Tracked top-level: `biomni/`, `biomni_env/`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`,
  `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `MANIFEST.in`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `Rpts_Ds_readme.md`, `run_biomni.py`, `upgrade.md`.
- `README.md` is **identical** to `Rpts_Ds_readme.md` (both 15702 B) — the project
  readme, not Biomni's original.

**Planned deviation from upgrade.md (needs confirmation)**
- Plan's strip list includes `docs`. But `biomni_env/` and `docs/` are **upstream
  Biomni's own files** (env-setup scripts; Sphinx docs). Per the repo convention
  "keep divergence from upstream minimal," deleting upstream files makes future
  rebases messier and isn't needed for an editable install. **Intended: KEEP
  `biomni_env/` and `docs/`; strip only project-specific tracked files**
  (`run_biomni.py`, `CLAUDE.md`, `upgrade.md`, `Rpts_Ds_readme.md`).

**NOT yet done** (interrupted before executing): `git clone $OLD $FORK`, the strip
`git rm`, `PATCHES.md`, `pip install -e $FORK`, and the import-resolution checkpoint.
No `$FORK` directory exists yet.

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 1 DONE: patched Biomni extracted + editable-installed

Extracted the fork to `$FORK=/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/biomni-fork` and
editable-installed it. **Confirmed to keep `docs/` and `biomni_env/`** (upstream
files) — deviation from the plan's literal strip list, approved.

**Actions**
- `git clone $OLD $FORK` — cheap (7.2 MB `.git`); no untracked data dirs carried.
- Stripped project-specific tracked files: `git rm run_biomni.py CLAUDE.md
  upgrade.md Rpts_Ds_readme.md`. Kept `biomni/`, `pyproject.toml`, `MANIFEST.in`,
  `LICENSE`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, **`biomni_env/`,
  `docs/`**.
- Wrote `$FORK/PATCHES.md` (folds in `fix_prefill_20260327.md` + the llm.py
  sampling-param/`max_tokens` patch).
- Commit: **`3bcdf5f`** "Strip to installable Biomni fork; add PATCHES.md".
  `origin` left pointing at `$OLD` (local) as the rebase source.
- `pip install -e $FORK --no-deps --no-build-isolation` in `biomni_e1` — this
  **uninstalled the shadowing site-packages `biomni 0.0.8` wheel** and installed
  the editable fork.

**Checkpoint — ALL PASS** (run from `/tmp`, so no cwd shadowing):
- `import biomni` → `/blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/biomni-fork/biomni` ✅
  (not site-packages, not `$OLD`).
- `_anthropic_rejects_sampling_params('claude-opus-4-8')` → `True`;
  `('claude-sonnet-4-6')` → `False` ✅.
- `a1.py` observation appended as `HumanMessage` ✅.
- `pip show biomni` → "Editable project location: .../biomni-fork" ✅.

**Notes / follow-ups**
- `$FORK/README.md` is currently the *project* readme (identical to the removed
  `Rpts_Ds_readme.md`), not Biomni's original — flagged in PATCHES.md; replace if
  desired.
- The old repo still has its local `biomni/` package dir; with the 0.0.8 wheel
  now gone, its `sys.path.append("./")` still works from its own root as a
  fallback, but the fork is the live install.

**Next**: Phase 3 — migrate keepers into `$PROJECT` (harness/, queries/, db/,
analysis/, manuscript/, results/) and the instant `mv` of `data/`, then repoint
`run_biomni.py` paths.

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 3 DONE: keepers migrated into George

Copied all keepers into `$PROJECT` and moved `data/`. Commit **`c41e411`**
"Migrate keepers into George (Phase 3)".

**Copied (originals left intact in `$OLD` archive)**
- `run_biomni.py` → `harness/`; `512GB.sbatch`, `196GB.sbatch` → `harness/slurm/`.
- `query_05_b.txt` → `queries/`; `query_01..05.txt` → `archive/queries/`.
- `ms/5UTR_TNR_0605.pdf` → `manuscript/`; `AG_DB_DESIGN.md` → `db/`.
- `pathogenic_repeat_analysis.ipynb`, `Candidate_Identification.ipynb`,
  `Evaluate.ipynb`, `Verify.ipynb` → `analysis/`.
- `Top_Candidate_Pathogenic_repeats.csv` → `results/`.
- adapted `CLAUDE.md` (new layout, run-from-root, fork/gotchas) → `$PROJECT/`.
- `upgrade.md`, `upgrade_log.md`, `.env` (gitignored) → `$PROJECT/`.

**Moved (the one change to `$OLD`)**
- `mv $OLD/Rpt_Ds/data $PROJECT/data` — instant rename (same `/blue/zhou` mount),
  after asserting the target was absent. `$OLD/Rpt_Ds/data` no longer exists
  (expected; reversible with the reverse `mv`; backups also exist).
- Symlinked the 15G local data-lake cache: `$PROJECT/biomni_data_cache ->
  $OLD/biomni_data_cache` (76 lake files). Reversible/free; NOT in the plan's
  inventory but required by `run_biomni.py`. **George is otherwise self-contained
  (its `data/` is a real dir); to fully detach later, `mv` the cache in.**

**Harness path updates (`run_biomni.py`)**
- Dropped `sys.path.append("./")` (biomni is the editable fork now).
- `QUERY_FILE` → `queries/query_05_b.txt`; `DATA_FILES` → `data/5UTR/...`;
  default `--output-dir` → `output`. Kept the corrected 5-entry `DATA_FILES`.
- sbatch scripts: `python harness/run_biomni.py ...`, output under `output/`,
  "submit from repo root" note added.

**Checkpoint — ALL PASS** (run from `$PROJECT`):
- `python harness/run_biomni.py --help` → exit 0 (no shadow error; loaded `.env`).
- All 5 `DATA_FILES` resolve (three ~30 GB AG TSVs + catalog + pathogenic) and
  `QUERY_FILE` resolves.
- `import biomni` → `.../biomni-fork/biomni` (fork).
- `./biomni_data_cache` resolves to 76 lake files via the symlink.

**Gotcha hit & fixed**: git `.gitignore` doesn't support inline `# comments` —
`biomni_data_cache  # …` briefly staged the symlink. Moved the comment to its own
line; verified `git check-ignore` catches `biomni_data_cache`, `.env`, `data`,
`output`.

**Next**: Phase 4 — build the AG DuckDB/Parquet backend per `db/AG_DB_DESIGN.md`
(prototype ETL on one file, then full 5'UTR ETL → `data/ag_db/`, then
`db/query_ag.py`).

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 4 IN PROGRESS: ETL authored + sample-validated (full run not submitted)

Installed `duckdb` 1.5.4 into `biomni_e1` (`pip`). Environment note: this repo
is worked from inside a SLURM interactive job (4 CPU / **32 GB**), on a heavily
shared node — hence the full ETL is a dedicated sbatch, not an in-session run.

**Phase 4 step 1 — exploration (`db/etl/explore.py`, done).** Three streaming
passes over `B_5UTR_all_GCN_2xAG.tsv` (~6 min each on the contended node):
- **102,782,767 rows**; 6,650 variants; 11 output_types; 19 scorers;
  4,619 track_names; 19,269 gene_names; **19,695 gene_ids** (gene_id is finer).
- Per-row gene confirmed nullable exactly as designed: `RNA_SEQ`/`SPLICE_*`
  always have a gene; `ATAC`/`CHIP_TF`/`CHIP_HISTONE`/`CAGE`/`DNASE`/
  `CONTACT_MAPS`/`PROCAP` always blank.
- All 19 `variant_scorer` strings enumerated; families: CenterMask, ContactMap,
  GeneMaskActive, GeneMaskLFC, GeneMaskSplicing, Polyadenylation, SpliceJunction.
  `width=None` present (GeneMaskSplicing) → parses to NULL. Parse regex verified.

**ETL design choices (vs the raw design doc):**
- **Hashed track key.** track_name is not unique across biosamples, so the
  13 track-metadata cols are `md5(concat_ws('||', coalesce(col,'')…))`-hashed into
  `track_key`; the 100M-row fact joins tracks on that one column (not a 13-way
  equality join). `coalesce` first so NULLs are kept positionally.
- **genes deduped by `gene_id`** (ensembl), the natural key, so the fact's LEFT
  JOIN can't fan out; name/type/strand taken via `min()` (functionally dependent).
- **Idempotent fact**: each `build_fact(expansion)` drops its own
  `region=5UTR/expansion=E/` dirs then writes with `APPEND` (so it never clobbers
  the other expansions). Dims built once from the 2x file (identical across exps).

**Dry-run on a 2M-row `head` sample (AG_OUT=/tmp, no full scan) — ALL PASS:**
- dims build; scorers=19, output_types=11 (tracks/genes sample-limited, expected).
- fact = **1,999,999 rows = sample − header → INNER joins on variants/scorers
  dropped nothing.** 11 output_type partitions written.
- **FK integrity:** 0 orphan `scorer_id`; `track_id` NULLs == raw blank
  track_name (hashed join matched every tracked row); `gene_id` NULLs ==
  raw blank gene_id (921,033 == 921,033).
- **Value parity:** RNA_SEQ `raw_score` sum for a sample variant identical
  raw-vs-fact (1429.2969 == 1429.2969).

**NOT yet done:** the real full ETL (submit `db/etl/build_ag_db.sbatch`),
`validate.py` against the real DB, size/time measurement, and `query_ag.py`.
Nothing destructive; source TSVs untouched (Phase 7 is the only delete step).

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 4 DONE: AG backend built, validated, query tool live

**Full ETL run** (`sbatch db/etl/build_ag_db.sbatch`, job 37734973): COMPLETED
in **18m41s**, exit 0, peak RAM **28.5 GB** (250 GB requested — overkill; ~64 GB
would do). First submit (job 37734801) failed at `conda activate`
(`MKL_INTERFACE_LAYER: unbound variable`) — `set -euo pipefail`'s `-u` breaks
conda's activate.d; fixed by activating before `set -eo pipefail` (no `-u`) and
`cd`-ing to the repo root so submit-dir doesn't matter.

**`data/ag_db/` = 2.0 GB** (vs ~90 GB TSV):
- dims: variants 6,650 · tracks 5,563 · genes 19,695 · scorers 19 ·
  output_types 11 · regions 1.
- `ag_scores` partitioned region/expansion/output_type: 2x=102,782,767,
  5x=104,210,211, 20x=104,366,423 (~311M rows). 5x/20x have more
  SPLICE_JUNCTIONS/RNA_SEQ rows than 2x (larger expansions → more junctions) —
  expected; the non-genic outputs (ATAC/CHIP/…) are identical across expansions.

**Validation (`db/etl/validate.py` → "ALL CHECKS PASSED"):**
- 2x fact total == raw file (102,782,767) → INNER joins dropped nothing.
- FMR1 (`X-147912050-147912110-CGG`) @2x: row count 14,172==14,172 and RNA_SEQ
  `raw_score` sum 270.6513==270.6513 vs the raw TSV.
- 7 pathogenic loci flagged (ABCD3, DIP2B, FMR1, GIPC1, LRP12, PPP2R2B, XYLT1).
- quantile_score ∈ [-1,1]; no orphan scorer_id. A tiny set of raw_score are NULL
  (792/5,544/18,216 per expansion) — blank in source, faithfully preserved.
- Note: `validate.py` made env-overridable (`AG_THREADS`/`AG_MEM`, default
  4/24GB) so it runs on the small interactive node without OOM.

**`query_ag` live-tested against the real backend:**
- aggregation (pathogenic vs background mean RNA_SEQ per expansion) runs
  full-dataset, tiny result;
- inspect cap: 7,261,800-row query → first 1000 + TRUNCATED note;
- `to_file=` materialize: 73,014-row per-variant table → Parquet, head returned.

**Next: Phase 5** — wire `query_ag` into `run_biomni.py`.

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 5 DONE: harness rewired to the DB backend

Edited `harness/run_biomni.py` so the agent reaches AlphaGenome via `query_ag`
instead of loading TSVs:
- **`DATA_FILES`**: removed `AG_Predicted_{2x,5x,20x}_expansion` (the three
  ~30 GB TSVs); kept `Pathogenic_repeats` + `All_5UTR_GCN_catalog`; added the
  small browsable dim Parquets `AG_variants_dim`, `AG_tracks_dim`.
- **Tool registration**: `from query_ag import query_ag` (with
  `sys.path.insert` of `db/`), and `agent.add_tool(query_ag)` in
  `run_single_experiment` after `add_data`.
- **Prompt**: append an "AlphaGenome data access — REQUIRED METHOD" block (use
  `query_ag`, 1k-row cap is payload-only so aggregate; `to_file` for big
  derived tables; don't read raw TSVs) + `schema_doc()`.
- **cwd fix**: `os.environ.setdefault("AG_DB", <abs path>)` before importing
  query_ag, because `run_single_experiment` chdir's into each output dir — a
  relative `data/ag_db` would break there.

**Verification (no LLM):** py_compile OK; `--help` OK; the 4 `DATA_FILES` all
resolve; `schema_doc()` returns 4251 chars incl. a live column listing;
`query_ag` returns correct per-expansion counts (2x=102,782,767 etc.) AND
materializes to a relative path **while cwd is a temp dir** — proving the chdir
integration. Also published: `git remote add origin …/George.git`, merged the
remote's LICENSE init commit (`--allow-unrelated-histories`), pushed `main`.

**Not done (needs API / LLM):** Phase 5's dry-run checkpoint (agent actually
issues SQL via `query_ag`) and Phase 6 (full 5'UTR run + parity vs prior TSV
results). Left to the user to launch (`sbatch harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` or
`python harness/run_biomni.py s5 o4.8`). Source TSVs still untouched (Phase 7).

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 6 attempt #1 FAILED (submit-dir); sbatch scripts fixed

User submitted `harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` — job 37739070 (s5+o4.8, 48 CPU /
420 GB) **exited in 5s**: it was submitted from `harness/slurm/`, so
`python harness/run_biomni.py` looked for `harness/slurm/harness/run_biomni.py`
("No such file or directory"). The agent never ran — no `output/`, no API spend.

**Fix**: added `cd /blue/zhou/leizhou/Agents/George` to the top (post-`#SBATCH`)
of **both** `harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` and `196GB.sbatch`, so relative paths
resolve regardless of submit dir (same fix already in `db/etl/build_ag_db.sbatch`).
Neither uses `set -u`, so the conda/MKL trap doesn't apply here.

**Still pending**: resubmit `sbatch harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` for the real
Phase 6 run, then parity check vs `results/Top_Candidate_Pathogenic_repeats.csv`.

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 6 DONE: 5'UTR run on the DB backend + parity review

`sbatch harness/slurm/512GB.sbatch` → **job 37739580, COMPLETED 15m57s, 2/2
experiments successful** (s5 + o4.8), output in `output/July_20_2026/`.
(A near-simultaneous duplicate submit 37739611 was cancelled; the earlier
37739070 was the pre-fix 5s failure.)

**Backend usage proven**: per-experiment logs show `query_ag` calls (s5: 8,
o4.8: 2) and **zero** reads of `B_5UTR_all_GCN_*AG.tsv`. The agent materialized
derived Parquets (`per_variant_summary.parquet`, `atac_variant_stats.parquet`,
…) via `to_file=` and produced `Top_Candidate_Pathogenic_repeats.csv` per run.

**Parity vs prior (`results/…csv`, 50 loci):**
- prior ∩ o4.8 = 23/50 (46%); prior ∩ s5 = 16/50 (32%); 16 loci in all three
  (incl. RHOT1 17-32142451, MAB21L1 13-35476296, GLS 2-190880872, AFF2
  X-148500631).
- **s5 ∩ o4.8 = 31/50 (62%)** — same data + prompt, different model. This is the
  key control: an exploratory LLM analysis varies ~38% run-to-run by model
  alone, so the prior gap (different model AND different composite-score
  methodology) is expected analytical variation, not a data fault.
- Data-level parity independently proven in Phase 4; `query_ag` returns
  consistent scores (e.g. RHOT1 CAGE mean_raw ≈288 across 2/5/20x).

**Conclusion**: pipeline runs end-to-end on `ag_db` alone; data faithful to
source. Phase 6 gate satisfied. **Phase 7 (delete the 29 GB TSVs) awaits the
user's explicit approval** — destructive, backups elsewhere.

---

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 6 comparison notebook (DB vs TSV parity, quantified)

Built `analysis/CompareOutput_DBvsTSV.ipynb` (modelled on the old repo's
`CompareOutput_March26.ipynb`; builder `analysis/_build_compare_nb.py`, keys
copied to `analysis/Verifying_keys.txt`). Compares **6 experiments** — George's
new **DB** runs (s5, o4.8) vs the OLD **TSV** runs (s5, o4.8, same query/models,
day before) vs two older `o4.6·TSV` runs (Tmp0.7 + Tmp0.5). Executed; outputs in
`analysis/comparisons/` (`comparison_report.md`, `experiment_scores.csv`,
`overlap_shared_counts.csv`, `consensus_top_candidates.csv`,
`overlap_heatmap.png`, `consensus_list.png`).

**Results — parity holds strongly:**
- **Key recovery**: both new DB runs + s5/o4.8/o4.6-T.7 TSV recover **both YES
  loci (AFF2, GLS)**; points 130–150. DB runs (o4.8=150, s5=130) sit in the same
  band as TSV. (Outlier: the older `o4.6·T.5` TSV run recovered 0 YES keys / 40
  pts — a property of that specific run, not the backend.)
- **Overlap (top-50)**: same-model DB-vs-TSV = s5 **32**, o4.8 **38**; the
  cross-model baseline (s5-vs-o4.8) = **31** (DB) / **38** (TSV); even same-model
  same-backend temperature swap (o4.6 T.7-vs-T.5) = **30**. Backend swap
  introduces **no more divergence than a model or temperature swap** → the DB is
  not a source of drift.
- **Consensus top-15**: RHOT1 (#1, in all 6), CARM1, EXOC3, TMEM185A (#4, all 6)
  top the list; both YES keys land at #5 (AFF2) and #8 (GLS); Possible keys
  TMEM185A/BCLAF3/NCOR2 also surface. Biologically consistent across backends.

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 7 DONE: source TSVs deleted (~86 GB reclaimed)

With Phase 6 parity confirmed and quantified, and after explicitly flagging that
**no external raw-TSV backup could be verified** (searched /orange/zhou + likely
roots; only copies were in George; the old repo's data was mv'd here in Phase 3),
the user approved deletion. Removed:
`data/5UTR/B_5UTR_all_GCN_{2x,5x,20x}AG.tsv` (30,437,452,420 + 30,837,853,364 +
30,853,300,168 B ≈ 86 GB). Kept the small `B_Cat_5UTR_GCNs_masked.tsv` +
`B_5UTR_Pathogenic_GCN.txt`.

**Checkpoint — pipeline runs on `ag_db` alone (PASS):**
- `query_ag` returns correct per-expansion counts (2x=102,782,767, 5x=104,210,211,
  20x=104,366,423) with the TSVs gone.
- All harness `DATA_FILES` resolve (catalog, pathogenic, + the two dim Parquets);
  none referenced the deleted TSVs.
- Guarded `db/etl/validate.py` §3 (raw spot-check) to SKIP gracefully when the
  raw TSV is absent — it passed pre-deletion; re-runs no longer error.

**Data preservation note**: the raw scores now exist only inside `data/ag_db/`
(validated bit-faithful in Phase 4). Re-running `db/etl/etl.py` requires the
TSVs, so ETL is effectively frozen unless they're restored from an external
backup. `db/query_ag.py` + the harness are unaffected.

## 2026-07-21 — Phase 8 DONE: old repo frozen as archive. MIGRATION COMPLETE.

Archived `$OLD = Biomni_Rpts_Ds`:
- Added `$OLD/README_ARCHIVED.md` (points to George + biomni-fork; what changed;
  what remains) and an archive banner atop `$OLD/README.md`.
- Committed the migration docs there too (`upgrade.md`, `upgrade_log.md`).
- Commit **`66e7d5f`** "Archive: superseded by George + biomni-fork"; annotated
  tag **`archive-pre-migration`**; pushed main + tag to
  github.com/leizhou69/Biomni_Rpts_Ds.
- Left the ~292 GB `Rpt_Ds/output/` run history in place (provenance).

**Checkpoint**: George runs fully on its own `data/` + `data/ag_db/`; the only
remaining link to `$OLD` is the `biomni_data_cache` symlink (still valid — the
archive persists). Optional final detach = `mv` the cache into George.

**Post-migration checklist (upgrade.md) — status:**
- ✅ `import biomni` → biomni-fork from any cwd.
- ✅ `run_biomni.py` runs from George, no `sys.path.append`.
- ✅ Agent queries AG via `query_ag` (no 29 GB reads; verified Phase 6).
- ✅ 5'UTR parity confirmed; source TSVs removed; ~86 GB reclaimed.
- ✅ `$OLD` tagged/archived; George + biomni-fork are the live repos.
- ⬜ 3'UTR onboarding (future; `db/etl/etl.py` is env-parameterized for it, but
     needs 3'UTR AG TSVs + catalog to run).
